        OUR HISTORY
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The story of New Life Dream Foundation is deeply rooted in the mission
        of our parent organization,{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-black">New Life Dream Centers</span>, which was
        founded over 39 years ago in Long Island, New York, by{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-black">Pastor Gaspar Anastasi</span>. The
        journey began when Pastor Anastasi, moved by the overwhelming needs of
        the people in his community, took in a homeless man and dedicated his
        life to helping those who had lost hope. This act of compassion sparked
        the establishment of New Life Dream Centers, where thousands of lives
        have been transformed through faith, discipline, and love.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Inspired by the success and impact of the original center in the United
        States, New Life Dream Foundation was established in Nigeria as an
        extension of this life-changing work. While we are a distinct entity,
        our foundation is built upon the same principles and values that have
        guided the New Life Dream Centers for decades. We are committed to
        bringing the same spirit of hope, restoration, and community upliftment
        to the people of Nigeria, with a special focus on addressing the unique
        challenges faced by individuals in our region.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        In partnership with our counterparts in the US, we aim to create a
        lasting legacy of positive change, helping individuals reclaim their
        purpose and rebuild their lives on a foundation of faith, love, and
        resilience.
